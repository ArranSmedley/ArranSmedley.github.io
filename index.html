                                    <p>The purpose of this project was to create and produce a game artefact in which uses advanced games engineering techniques. This artefact can be anything related to games engineering so long as it met a certain criteria of requirements. By the knowledge I have gained throughout my time at university I created an efficient game User Interface in which uses the 3 different aspects within the game User Interface sector, these consist of Meta, Spatial and Diegetic. With also the addition of an A* pathfinder to represnt parts of the spatial UI. The documentation to this project can also be found in the project downloads folder.

                                    <p class="mb-2">Fantasy & Ash is a game I developed in my 3rd Year of Univeristy, written in C++ and SFML. Set in the land of Kyntera, Andrel, a high-level member of a local adventurer’s guild is killed on a routine quest under suspicious circumstances. He awakens to find that they have been reborn as a level 1 adventurer, with only a note from the kingdom explaining his situation and a sword. He must work his way back to his previous position by completing quests and hunting monsters, all while trying to uncover what happened. By fighting orc's and skeleton's Andrel and his party will atain experience aswell as gold in order to pay their way back into the kingdom. </p>

Set in the thick of world war two, Lieutenant George Andrews has been captured and held prisoner by the Germans, due to high volumes in the prisoner camps the Lieutenant has been sent to the Jewish camps to face the horrors alone. In this top down prison escape, you will be faced with challenges such as sneaking passed guards, picking up letters which in turn give ideas to find tools in order to escape the prison.</p>

								   The outcome was a successful prototype that had three different map generation 
								   algorithms consisting of Cellular Automata, Perlin Noise and Delaunay Triangulation with the paper being graded a 2:1.</p>

In conjunction with this, I was given practical python scripting experience measuring network performance for a client of Calnex. Furthermore, I provided ABB testing for certain components within the Calnex solutions software. Each task required high levels of team communication within a scrum and cohesion with the scrum manager to ensure that whomever requested the task be done, whether that be a client or Calnex management were more than satisfied with the job done.</p>
